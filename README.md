Bootstrap Angular & NestJS environments

## Assumptions

There are a few points on the specification which are not quite clear to me. In a real world scenario, I would seek clarification on those points. As this is an exercise, I will be making assumptions based on what I think best fits the specification. These assumptions are listed below:

- Grid size - the high fidelity prototype shows a 8x8 grid, whereas the text below specifies the grid should be 10x10. This is then reinforced in the Bonus 1: Payments Page, where it mentions "all 100 cells" of the grid (implying 10x10). As such, I chose to proceed with a 10x10 grid.
